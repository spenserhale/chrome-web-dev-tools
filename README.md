Chrome Web Development Tools
=========

A Chrome Extension which has a bundle of tools for web developers and website owners.

FEATURE - Passwords and Login
--------

*Save Passwords to local chrome storage
*Auto log in to WordPress sites

FEATURE - Server IP
--------

*Simple solution to always show the current websites IP address instead of clicking through an extension 
*Moves left or right on mouse over it won't get in your way 
*IPv6 support 
*No external server to return IP

TODOs
--------

Currently I'm planning a few features: 
*More Auto Login Website Support
*Automatically tell/ highlight broken links
*Automatically tell image natural size is double of its usage on page
*Check for Google Analytics and Schema
